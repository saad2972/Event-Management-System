This C-based Event Scheduling System allows users to manage and organize events efficiently through a simple console interface. With this project, users can add new events,
display all upcoming (active) events, cancel specific events, and view a list of past or cancelled events. The system also includes file persistence,
meaning all event data is saved to and loaded from a file (event_records.txt) to maintain records across sessions. This is a beginner-friendly project ideal for learning file I/O operations,
working with structures, and implementing a menu-driven program in C.
